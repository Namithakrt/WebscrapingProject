We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Instead of you wading through pages of clickbait Google results or adding \"reddit\u201d to your search, we serve you the products you would otherwise spend hours researching for. \r\n\r\nAs the internet and search have evolved, it has become increasingly obvious that searching the whole internet is now a bug, not a feature. In today\u2019s era of constant information overload, finding the best products to meet your needs amid a sea of SEO-spam and sneaky advertising has never been harder. Imagine trying to find an effective skincare routine, currently you have to comb through countless YouTube videos and Reddit threads to understand the steps of what an ideal routine looks like for you before even deciding which products you want. Lumona simplifies those steps into one search, showing the best products for you, as recommended by the content creators you watch and the communities you visit every day, in one place. \r\n\r\nWe have been working together since meeting during our sophomore year at MIT, recently winning first place at the HackMIT hackathon this past September. As part of MIT\u2019s student-run Web Lab class, we taught over 300 students modern web development. Growing up in the age of social media, we\u2019ve always been influenced by content creators in the products we buy, and have spent endless hours learning how to research and shop for the products we need amid an internet drowning in noise. We are committed to fixing product search\u2014so that you never have to add \u201creddit\u201d to the end of your searches ever again.",

That became possible by recent advancements in ML and the power of M1 chips for local processing.\r\n\r\nWe are non-native founders who solve their pain, and have deep expertise in running ML on edge devices.",

Conversational flows often feel awkward with unnatural pauses and interruptions, requests are frequently misunderstood, and voices sound robotic or overly dramatic.

Moreover, these data files and reports cannot be easily reused due to poor data infrastructure. \r\n\r\nPowered by AI, our product cuts hours of data wrangling work down to minutes and makes it possible to query past data easily. This helps firms evaluate assets faster and win more deals.\r\n\r\nSince launching last month, we've started a pilot with a brokerage team at a public investment bank that now uses our product daily. Aiming to serve over 100,000 investment teams needing complex data analysis for alternative investments, this opens up a potential $5 billion market.",

On top of that, customer support agents often burn out leading to turnover and reduced quality. As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge, which is hard to access at scale and makes keeping employees up-to-date nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nMarkprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI. Built from the ground up with an API-first approach, Markprompt provides SDKs (such as React hooks and components) and no-code tools to enable integrations at all touchpoints in the customer journey.",

This enables teams to rapidly accelerate the technical discovery process and save significant resources. \r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS: Driver AI works by digesting a codebase, organizing it for analysis, and harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate interactive explanations for executives, product and technology leaders, and developers.\r\n\r\n\"Driver AI is a paradigm shift for managing our complex software delivery pipeline.\" - Executive Vice President, Global Semiconductor Company",

We sell the data to financial companies that want to invest into the best performing energy companies.\r\n\r\nUntil today, oil & gas companies use excel-based emission factors to calculate and report their emissions. As these excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance companies that invest into oil & gas can\u2019t mitigate against incoming risks from new regulations, \r\n\r\nWe have built a technology that can for the first time use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation. In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\r\nLearn more at https://orbio.earth",

Currently, doctors miss >50% of moms who have life-threatening complications and wait until labor to start doing manual risk assessments, at which point it's too late.\r\n\r\nElythea's proprietary ML models catch life-threatening obstetric complications (like postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia/eclampsia, emergency c-section, preterm labor, and more) as soon as the first visit. We automatically analyze relevant demographic and clinical risk factors, flag high-risk patients, and provide evidence-based interventions, giving doctors months in advance to intervene and prevent complications from ever happening.\r\n\r\nOur global clinical studies have shown that we can catch 2-3x more complications than clinical judgment 10x sooner.",

Maven is building the platform that will allow stakeholders of all disciplines to effectively evaluate therapeutic opportunities. \r\n\r\n169 Drugs each year fail in clinical development due to business and commercial reasons (only ~60 drugs are approved annually). That number represents roughly 20% of all clinical development programs, or roughly $28 billion in sub-optimal R&D dollars annually. At Maven Bio, our goal is to halve the commercial failure rate and thereby increase the number of drugs that are approved and available to patients. \r\n\r\nTo start, Maven is building a biopharma commercial intelligence platform which allows corporate development teams to rapidly construct deal landscapes and conduct comparative analyses. Maven empowers users with evidence-backed insights based on their business context. Over time, Maven will add additional knowledge areas to the platform to provide an increasingly comprehensive and accurate assessment of a therapeutic opportunity.",

Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\r\n\r\nWhy? Small businesses are the heart of the American economy and a lot of banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes and unlocks affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US as opposed to the high interest rates from online lenders.",

We connect to smart thermostats, HVAC systems, batteries and EV chargers to automatically lower consumption during peak times. \r\n\r\n\r\nElectrification is at the core of the UK\u2019s net zero strategy. However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.",

            "Description": "## What is Yuma?\r\n\r\nYuma is using LLMs to automate customer support. We integrate directly with help desk software and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n \r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, we believe that the recent advances in AI technology finally make solving this problem achievable.\r\n\r\nBy coupling LLMs with custom-built knowledge bases, Yuma is able to suggest drafts that are relevant and customized to the support agents. With a one-click install, Yuma can natively integrate with any help desk software without disrupting current workflows, but only augmenting them.\r\n\r\nBy using LLMs to analyze historical tickets, Yuma can mimic the writing style of a brand, but also learn and replicate current workflows without any configuration needed, bringing the setup and adoption cost to almost zero.\r\n\r\nYuma also offers the ability to build a new kind of smart and dynamic workflows that were not possible before, with a plain English description of a given scenario.\r\n\r\nFinally, LLMs also make working with multiple languages a breeze. The agents can focus their work on a single language, knowing that their output will always be appropriate and grammatically correct.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

Lightski helps you embed and white-label an easy-to-use AI Data Scientist into your app, giving your users the ability to perform arbitrary, powerful data analysis on their data. \r\n\r\nLightski connects to your database, transforms the data to a clean schema, and loads it into an AI chatbot embedded inside your app. Your users can then ask arbitrary data questions; in response, the AI Data Scientist will write python code. We\u2019ll then safely execute that code in an isolated execution environment. This allows your users to: \r\n\r\n- Create custom graphs, charts, and dashboards\r\n- Perform arbitrary filters, group-bys, and aggregations\r\n- Transform or clean data for a custom CSV export\r\n\r\nBy writing and executing Python code to answer user questions, we provide grounded answers that avoid hallucinations. Since code is infinitely flexible, this approach enables arbitrary data questions to be quickly answered, without fiddling with UI, schemas, or technical knowledge. \r\n\r\nAnything that a data scientist can accomplish in code can now be accomplished with Lightski. Best of all, your users won\u2019t even know we\u2019re powering the experience\u2014you can quickly re-theme our UI with your design system. Reach out at founders@lightski.com for a demo!",

By teaching our body\u2019s immune system to recognize and kill the drivers of cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.\r\n\r\nA little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn\u2019t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually \u2013 preventing the majority of cancer deaths. \r\n\r\nOur team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden\u2019s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning more about our approach to treat and prevent cancer, please reach out to us at contact@adventrispharma.com",

As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\r\n\r\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \r\n\r\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.",

Dendritic cells sit at the helm of the immune system, directing and dictating immune responses. Data has shown dendritic cells are often dysfunctional in cancer patients, and that this dysfunction is a bottleneck for other therapies. \r\n\r\nGuardian Bio\u2019s approach is focused on creating a dendritic cell-based product which drives anti-tumor activity through activating the killers of the immune system AND training them against multiple cancer targets. We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient\u2019s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. \r\n\r\nOur therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer.",

Approximately half the population will be diagnosed with this pain and progressive disease.\r\nRight now, patients have to undergo not only repeat injections to control their pain, but also have to take strong oral medications. Because the disease is progressive and only gets worse over time, many patients end up on highly addictive, high-dose opioids. \r\nTo date, we have secured $3.7 million in non dilutive funding and completed preclinical testing. We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nMy co-founder and I are Chemists with PhDs in Biomedical Engineering and we have an experienced leadership team already in place.\r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.",

Companies rely on old compensation survey data, which are updated only once every year.\r\n\r\nThe salary expectations of candidates in the market change significantly on a quarterly basis (~7% statistically) in the startup ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis results in more than 50% of qualified/selected candidates not joining the company due to expectation mismatch.\r\n\r\nCompUp is an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool. We integrate with your existing HR/payroll systems, removing the need for manual data entry, and also getting updated in real-time.\r\n\r\nCompUp provides the most accurate real-time compensation benchmarking data which helps you make the right offer to the candidate. The platform allows you to make better compensation decisions such as annual increments, candidate offers using internal and external data. \r\n\r\nThis has the following advantages :\r\n- All the process of compensation data submission is automatic and needs no manual intervention\r\n- Since the job market is dynamic in nature, the offers made on CompUp's real-time benchmarks would be the most efficient\r\n- The presentation of the offer to the candidate makes it look more appealing and explanatory to the candidate",

These designs are created using real furniture from top brands. \r\nWe help homebuyers see the potential of their next home and turn that into a reality.\r\nFor example, when a young married couple with a baby visits the website we host, instead of seeing a dull property listing on Zillow with empty pictures or old furniture, the family sees realistic and personalized virtual interior designs \u2013 such as a home office and a baby room \u2013 which we automatically generate for them. They can then play with those designs and see how that home fits their needs and tastes and buy those furniture directly from Apply Design.\r\n\r\nThis is a $20B market opportunity, given the 50M properties sold or rented annually in North America and Europe alone.",

            "Description": "Gullak is a mobile app that automates savings & invests these in Gold. We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak\u2019s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.",
