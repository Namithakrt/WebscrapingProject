# Webscraping Challenge
The project aims to extract structured data from the Y Combinator website (https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) specifically focusing on information about companies listed on the platform. The goal is to gather comprehensive details about each company, including its name, description, founding year, team size, location, batch, industry tags, social media links, and founders' information. The project utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from the Y Combinator website. The scraping methodology involved using a combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract data from the website. The extracted data stored in csv file and JSON file for further analysis.
